        <p>Hi! I am Joey Young. I am a highschool graduate who is looking at getting into a programming career. I am an interesting person I would say. I like computers and 
            pretty much all types of music. I like a lot of things. I don't  have much job experience, I worked in a warehouse for a summer and a tshirt shop for a little over a week.
            I am looking to grow a lot through the classes I am taking and would love if you kept checking up on my work every once in a while!
        </p>
